## ReferenceR

An application designed to be a tool for artists looking for inspiration to start or finish a work of art.

When you are creating something, you may want to follow some references, sometimes your work only ends up the way it is because you were inspired by other works.

Being an artist means studyin how things work, such as composition, light and shadow, perspective, gesture, and many other things. There are many materials on the internet that could help you with this. 

[DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com) is a social network where artists publish their work, whether they are beginners or established artists. It is a network that contains many photographic works by people who studied a lot to compose their works, which inspire people all over the world.

ReferenceR can initially extract photographs and images from any of the thousands of galleries on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com), and can show them to the user. After searching for an artist and opening their profile, the user can favorite their albums and see them on their collections page.

Ideally, ReferenceR is not just for displaying artists' works, as [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com) does. The plan is that users can create albums from different albums by different artists, and in the future, from other platforms. You might be wondering: why would this be useful?

### Gesture Drawing

It's no secret that the more you practice a technique, the more you master it, and this is no different when you need to practice methods that make your drawings more expressive, without them looking artificial or cold.

A great way to practice gestures is to draw as many pose references as possible. In a short period of time, you can analyze the flow of the drawing and identify the lines of action. What artists do is impose a period of time on each reference to study it and extract its essence. Usually, this time is short, like 30 seconds, and in that time the artist can sketch each pose, and thus gain some experience. This practice greatly improves the development of future drawings.
